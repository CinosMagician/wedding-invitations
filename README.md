## Objective

The aim of Diplomacy is to be the last man stading, going [bankrupt](#bankrupt) means you lose and are out of the game. Build up different rules with different conditions and effects to strategise your way to victory and amass a fortune.

## Cards

There are a few different type of cards included in Diplomacy, there are [Regents](#regents), [Rules](#rules) and [Special Cards](#special-cards).

### Regents

There are 3 different types of Regents, Jacks, Queens and Kings. Each have a Rank represented by the number of diamonds on the cards from 1 through 4.
Regents are able to be played at anytime during your turn and also can even be sold while in play. You may only control 1 of each type of Regent.
Regents are used to play their corresponding [Rules](#rules) cards.

### Rules

There are 3 different types of rules cards that match the color of the represented [Regents](#regents). The orange cards are known as King rules, the pink are Queen rules and the blue are Jack rules, each require you to have that corresponding regent in play to use.

### Special Cards

There are 3 special cards, These are AND, OR and Joker cards.

#### AND & OR

AND & OR cards can be played next to an existing King or Queen Rule card in play (These do not award any gold) and cannot be used with Jack rules.
AND will now make it so both King Rule conditions will need to be met in order for the Queen rule to take effect, OR will make it so either condition needs to be met for the Queen rule.
AND cards used on Queen rules will make it so if the King rule is met, BOTH effects will apply with the original effect taking place first then the new rule. OR will make it so the turn player will get to choose which effect takes place and the other is disregarded.

#### Joker

Jokers are special as they are the only card that takes effect immediatly after being drawn, regardless of who's turn it currently is. Joker cards will take cards from the top of the deck until it reveals 1 of each Rule card, using the first one of each drawn until a brand new rule is created. After which all other cards drawn from this will be discarded along with the Joker, then you draw 1 card. (TBA what happens when the rules are capped out)

## Setup

To start the game, have the regents separate from the main deck. Each player starts with 2 gold and draws 7 cards from the main deck, then each player is given 2 random Regents from the Regent deck, after which the regents are shuffled into the main deck.
To determin who goes first, A King Regent of the highest rank is required, If no one has a Rank 4 King, it will then go down to Rank 3 King, then Ranks 2 and 1. If no one still owns a King Regent of any rank, it will start from Rank 4 Queen and go down. If 2 players have the same highest regent, it is whoever reveals it first may start. The game is then played clockwise.

## Gameplay

Turns begin by looking at the current rules in play and either:
- Apply the rules from left to right
- Pay the current [Tax](#tax) to skip all rules this turn

Once the rule phase is over, you will have a few different actions you can perform. You may:
- Sell and number of cards in your hand/Played Regents for 1 gold per card
- Play any number of Regents from your hand to the board
- Draw 1 card from the deck OR Play a rule card if you control that corresponding Regent and if there is a valid space for it

There are certain contidions to play rule cards:
King rules can be played in any open King Rule space or over the top of an exisiting King Rule card.
Queen rules may only be played under an existing King Rule or over the top of an existing Queen Rule card.
Jack rules may only be played under an existing Queen Rule or over the top of an existing Jack Rule card.

There are a maximum number of King Rule slots, These are determined by the number of players. The number of slots equals to the number of players plus 1.
Each time a card is played into an open Rule slot, 1 gold is awarded to the player who played that card. Jokers do not reward gold when playing in an open rule slot.

### Tax

Tax is a mechanic where each time 3 Rule cards are played, the Tax will go up by 1 to a maximum of 4 and the game begins with Tax at 1. Tax is used to avoid applying the rules for your turn.

### Bankrupt

A player is bankrupt if they are required to pay gold and are sitting at 0 gold, being at 0 gold does not mean you have lost quite yet.
